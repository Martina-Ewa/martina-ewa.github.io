            <h2>Martina Wojciechowska</h2>
            <p>
                I am a third-year Mathematics student at the University Of British Columbia in Vancouver. 
                My main areas of interest are Probability, Statistics, Number Theory, and Analysis.
            </p>
            <p>
                Originally I am from a small town in southern Poland where I graduated high school and where I developed my love for Math. After I moved to Canada, my interest expanded to Computer Science, and I am now cultivating my passion in Data Science.
                In future pursuits, I am interested in the intersection of mathematical theory and practical applications.
            </p>
            <p>
                Outside of the world of numbers, I am a member of the Boxing Club at UBC, I love traveling (Amsterdam, I see you!) and lately, I have grown a passion and appreciation for wines.

            <h2>Analysis and Clustering of Spanish Wines</h2>
            <p>
                A beautiful country located on the Iberian Peninsula- Spain is worldly known for its wineries and excellent wines. 
                In this project, I applied Data Analysis, visualizations tools, and a Clustering Model to better understand the wine story that began thousands of years ago.
