                <h2>Martina Wojciechowska</h2>
                <p>
                    I am a third-year Mathematics student at the University Of British Columbia in Vancouver. 
                    My main areas of interest are Data Analysis and Machine Learnign.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Originally I am from a small town in southern Poland where I graduated high school and where I developed my love for Math. After I moved to Canada, my interest expanded to Computer Science, and I am now cultivating my passion in Data Science.
                    In future pursuits, I am interested in the intersection of mathematical theory and practical applications.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Outside of the world of numbers, I am a member of the Boxing Club at UBC, I love traveling and my goal is to go on a cycling road trip through Europe, and lately, I have grown a passion and appreciation for wines.

            <h2> What did they really mean: Sentiment Analysis of Tweets</h2>
            <p>
                This data science project focuses on developing a robust model for analyzing tweets and accurately
                assigning sentiment labels. By employing advanced NLP methods, we aim to transform raw tweet data into
                valuable insights, enhancing our understanding of public opinion and trends.
