                <h2>Martina Wojciechowska</h2>
                <p>
                    I am a third-year Mathematics student at the University Of British Columbia in Vancouver. 
                    My main areas of interest are Probability, Statistics, Number Theory, and Analysis.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Originally I am from a small town in southern Poland where I graduated high school and where I developed my love for Math. After I moved to Canada, my interest expanded to Computer Science, and I am now cultivating my passion in Data Science.
                    In future pursuits, I am interested in the intersection of mathematical theory and practical applications.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Outside of the world of numbers, I am a member of the Boxing Club at UBC, I love traveling (Amsterdam, I see you!) and lately, I have grown a passion and appreciation for wines.

            <h2>NLP Sentiment Analysis</h2>
            <p>
                In this project, I performed sentiment analysis on text data to classify sentiment as positive or negative. I used natural language processing techniques and machine learning algorithms to build and evaluate the sentiment analysis model.

            <p>
                A beautiful country located on the Iberian Peninsula- Spain is worldly known for its wineries and excellent wines. 
                In this project, I applied Data Analysis, visualizations tools, and a Clustering Model to better understand the wine story that began thousands of years ago.
